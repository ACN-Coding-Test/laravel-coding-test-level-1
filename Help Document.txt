Requirements:
Php 8 
Note: I have used laravel 9.

Fatct data from https://newsapi.org/v2
Fatach sources once in a day
Fatch articals 2 a day, due to the limit of use of free api.

How to configure Cron Jobs
* * * * * php /path/to/artisan schedule:run 1>> /dev/null 2>&1
OR
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1


I stored the articals in My database which are fatch from the give feed. Other option is that we do fatch when some one make a call to our page,
but that can make system slow and a lot of calls to the given feed and limited number of calls allowed can create problem, but that can be solved 
using different techniques like proxy ip and more accounts depend upon situation.


I have made a Home page, that will load some rendom 3 articals, then 5 sources with each 3 latest articals, I have also implemented the search on home page,
that will search on artical title for now.

There is a page for listing all the sources and there articals.

Then there is a details page. that will show image, auther, category, details, comments, can comment and it will work using ajax.

Note: I have not implemented any scrapper for any source as there is shortage of time as well as need to study a good library that is 
efficient also each artical veries, so need much time to invstigate and build one(other wise we can use regex to perfom scrapping that is also time taking). 

To test i have put only few articls for full content or details. these are listed below.
